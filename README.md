## Bonus and Salary taxation methods
The year-end bonus and the salary are different taxation methods in China, the taxation method of the year-end bonus will be higher, and the year-end bonus can only be declared once a year, so there are some cases, splitting the year-end bonus into two parts, part according to the year-end bonus taxation, part according to the salary taxation, will be lower than all according to the year-end bonus taxation amount, so as to optimize the taxation.  
## Functions
the project includes three functions.  

1 Caculating and Storing monthly payroll data (including tax, insurance, net pay，cumulative amount of tax due，cumulative amount of tax actually paid so on), In addition, China's personal tax is refundable, so the difference between the amount of tax due and the amount of tax actually paid for the year is calculated for the purpose of personal tax remittance.  

2 Caculating bonus tax(including pre tax, tax, net pay).  

3 Optimising tax on bonus.  


## Calculations of salary, insurance and bonus
